# **C++ Module 06**

This repository contains solutions to various C++ programming challenges from the 42 School curriculum. Each module is designed to deepen students' understanding of different programming concepts and techniques.

## **Exercises**

### **ex00 - Conversion of scalar types**
A program that converts various scalar types (char, int, float, double) from a string representation.

**Key objectives included:**

- Implementing a class to handle the conversion of scalar types.
- Managing exceptions for invalid conversions.
- Demonstrating an understanding of type casting and conversion in C++.

### **ex01 - Serialization**
A program that serializes and deserializes data structures.

**Key objectives included:**

- Implementing a class to serialize and deserialize data.
- Demonstrating the use of pointers and memory management.
- Ensuring data integrity during the serialization and deserialization process.

### **ex02 - Identify real type**
A program that identifies the real type of an object at runtime.

**Key objectives included:**

- Implementing a class to identify the real type of objects.
- Demonstrating the use of dynamic_cast and RTTI (Run-Time Type Information).
- Ensuring proper type identification and handling.
